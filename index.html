                        <h1>What is Pranic Healing?</h1>
                        <h2>
                            Pranic healing is a part of alternative therapies, a method of energy healing. It was founded and promoted by 
                            Grand Master Choa Kok Sui. Prana is called ‘chi’ in China and ‘ki’ in Japan. The word pranic was originated from 
                            a Sanskrit word ‘Prana’ which means life force.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            Life force (Prana) simply means energy. All matters in the universe are made up of energy. It is not just about 
                            our physical body we are talking about here. Even, our thoughts and feelings are also energy waves which actually 
                            can be measured through proper instruments.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            Even up and downs in your relationships, the amount of money you earn are all basically just energy patterns. 
                            And the most interesting part is that all humans have this natural ability to feel this energy and to modify it. 
                            But only a few of them can generally realize that and some of them use their knowledge to help others.
                        </h2>
    
                    </div>
                    <div class="aboutright">
                        <h1>How did it come to being?</h1>   
                        <h2>
                            In the 1980s, Filipino Master Choa Kok Sui conducted an exhaustive investigation into the power of energy 
                            for healing. He compiled and synthesized the knowledge of the Chinese, Indian Rishis (Hindi: 'wise, saint'), 
                            Taoists and Tibetan monks and designed a practical system of scientifically documented healing called 
                            Pranic Healing.
                        </h2> 
                        <h2>
                            This method of healing is based on the management of Prana and has been used for many years by oriental medicine with 
                            great success.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            And, therefore, Master Choa - through the Institute for Inner Studies, established in 1987 by him and The World 
                            Pranic Healing Foundation, created in 1990 - decided to teach this practice to spread it and make it available to everyone.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            And, although it does not replace the medicine practiced in Western hospitals, it does complement its results 
                            consistently and has achieved healing in cases of cancer, arthritis, migraines, chronic stress and gastritis, 
                            among other diseases.
                        </h2>
                        <h2>
                            To date, the Foundation, in addition to its branch office in India, has been able to help spread Pranic Healing in 
                            Indonesia, Bhutan, Nepal, Malaysia, Hongkong, Thailand, Srilanka, Singapore, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, 
                            Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, China, Pakistan, The Gambia, Benin, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, 
                            Niger, Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia, Tanzania, Mauritius and South Africa. Pranic Healing will continue 
                            to expand and spread out in the next few years to more and more countries.
